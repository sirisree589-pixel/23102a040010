# 🧠 Aspect-Sense: Deep-Dive Customer Feedback Analytics

## Overview
Aspect-Sense is a machine learning project designed to revolutionize how e-commerce platforms understand customer feedback. Instead of just labeling reviews as "positive" or "negative," this system dives deeper—automatically identifying **which product features**
Built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning**, this intelligent pipeline performs **two-level sentiment classification**:
- **Global Sentiment**: Overall tone of the review (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment**: Sentiment toward specific product features like *Performance*, *Design*, *Value for Money*, and *Shipping*

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms receive millions of reviews daily. Product managers need **actionable insights**, not just vague sentiment tags. For example:
> *"The camera is great, but the battery life is poor."*

This project identifies:
- **What** aspects are mentioned
- **How** customers feel about each one

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a joint classification model that accurately predicts both overall and aspect-level sentiments.
- Handle complex linguistic features like **negation** and **sarcasm**.
- Provide structured outputs for easy visualization and decision-making.

---

## 🧪 Technical Stack
- **Language Models**: BERT / RoBERTa (fine-tuned)
- **Deep Learning**: Hierarchical Attention Networks, Joint Classification
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK, Transformers (HuggingFace)
- **Visualization**: Plotly / Dash / Streamlit

---

## 📊 Output Format
Each review is processed to generate:
```json
{
  "review": "The product is amazing but delivery was slow.",
  "global_sentiment": "Positive",
  "aspects": {
    "Performance": "Positive",
    "Shipping": "Negative"
  }
}
```

---

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Combined Prediction Accuracy (CPA)**: Correct only if both global and aspect sentiments match ground truth.
- **Robustness**: Handles sarcasm, negation, and mixed sentiment.
